# To compile use:
# iverilog -o {output file name (optional)} {filename}
verilog -o hello hello.v

# Note that using a file list is possible with the -c file.txt command.... Make sure to add a line of white space at the end of file.txt though or the last item won't compile

# To run:
# vvp {filename} 
vvp hello
